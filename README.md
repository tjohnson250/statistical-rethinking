Exploration of McElreath's 2023-24 Statistical Rethinking Lectures
Richard McElreath has an excellent series of lectures available on
YouTube covering the Bayesian approach to science, data analysis
and causal inference. Unfortunately, the video lectures for 2023-24
cover material from the forthcoming third edition of his Statistical
Rethinking book, which is not yet available unless you take his class.

The lecture videos and slides do not fully explain the material, since
he expects students to read the book. In addition, the code in the slides
is sometimes incomplete and inconsistent.

This is my attempt to cover, understand, and explain the lectures using
fully executable code in R.
